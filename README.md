# Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-Supervised learning based on many techniques.
We mainly focused on threshold policies for pseudo labels of an unlabeled data.

This folder contains implemented SSL algorithms from various papers but not used in final version
Currently, we've implemented below models and functions for our training data.

 - MixMatch
 - Mean Teacher
 - FixMatch
 - SimCLR
 - RotNet
 - RandAugment

Also, it contains some baseline code fragments and some integrated versions of above codes that have been used in intermeditate steps of our project
